2024-09-12,"According to Cointelegraph, the TIME Magazine reporter who conducted one of the first foreign correspondent interviews with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele in three years has suggested that his push for Bitcoin as legal tender was more about image than substance. In an interview with Crooked Media’s Pod Save the World released on Sept. 11, Vera Bergengruen reported that Bukele’s advisers referred to Bitcoin (BTC) adoption in El Salvador as a “great rebranding” and “complete PR [public relations] move.” Bukele briefly led his family’s PR firm before moving into politics, becoming the Mayor of Nuevo Cuscatlán, Mayor of San Salvador, and president of El Salvador. “I think the most important thing [...] is his past as a publicist,” said Bergengruen, referring to Bukele. “It’s important to understand from Bitcoin to the war on the gangs, everything he does he’s kind of image first, results later oriented.” She added that Bitcoin was never really meant to be adopted to significantly change Salvadorans’ economic situation. Many in the crypto industry began paying attention to El Salvador and Bukele starting in 2021 after the president announced plans to recognize BTC as a legal tender. According to Bergengruen, the announcement was the first for the industry and the public in El Salvador, resulting in Bukele’s team having to “backtrack” and promote potential benefits of Bitcoin, like foreign remittances. “It was chaos from the start, but they needed to kind of at least pretend that it was really going to help El Salvador,” said Bergengruen. “It was very obvious that it was kind of for tourists, for foreigners, for [Bukele] to have something to talk about that changes the narrative. If that was the goal, they have been successful.” Bukele initially pushed for creating a volcano-powered “Bitcoin City” in the country, but the program was not completed more than three years later. He regularly posts on social media about using El Salvador’s funds to purchase BTC. According to Bergengruen’s interview, the president reported having roughly $400 million in the country’s “public wallet alone.” Bukele will serve as El Salvador’s president in his current term until 2029.",Time Magazine reporter Vera Bergengruen believes El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele's push for Bitcoin as legal tender was more about image than substance.

This development has increased the likelihood of a 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve to 85%, marking the highest probability in a month. In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded from its intraday low, climbing back above $57,000, indicating strong demand and growing bullish sentiment. This optimism is reflected in options activity, with a growing number of investors purchasing call options expiring between October and December. This week, BTC volatility decreased by 12 points due to the impact of the CPI data release and the presidential debate. With no significant macroeconomic events on the horizon, it is anticipated that volatility will continue to decline ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting. Given the upcoming rate cut and the U.S. presidential election, which are significant economic events, the market is building momentum.","The recently announced U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data met expectations and the core CPI rose slightly month-over-month to 0.3%, surpassing the forecasted 0.2%.

2024-09-12,"According to CoinDesk, RootstockCollective has been introduced as the first decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on Bitcoin layer-2 Rootstock. This new DAO will enable holders of the Rootstock token RIF to earn voting rights by staking their tokens. The launch signifies a continuation of concepts typically associated with Ethereum making their way to Bitcoin, the world's oldest blockchain. DAOs are blockchain-based organizations where decisions are made by token holders rather than a central authority. While DAOs are prevalent on networks like Ethereum and Solana, they have been largely absent from Bitcoin due to its programmability constraints. Rootstock, a layer-2 network, aims to enhance Bitcoin's utility and is compatible with Ethereum's EVM programming standard for smart contracts. This compatibility allows applications originally built on Ethereum or related chains to be easily transferred to Rootstock. The trend of building on Bitcoin gained traction in early 2023 with the Ordinals protocol, which introduced a Bitcoin version of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This trend has continued with the introduction of memecoins and other fungible tokens on the Runes protocol, and the BitVM computing paradigm, which facilitates smart contracts on Bitcoin. The RootstockCollective DAO aims to encourage builders and users of Rootstock by allowing RIF token holders to stake their tokens and earn voting rights. Staking involves users locking away their tokens to participate in the blockchain's verification process and receiving additional tokens as a reward.",RootstockCollective has been introduced as the first decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on Bitcoin layer-2 Rootstock.

2024-09-12,"This week, our desk noticed that BTC market volatility started to pick up, with multiple key data releases on the US labour market and CPI before next week’s FOMC meeting. BTC price was closely tracking the US equities performance, while some altcoins had a more independent journey.Sui ($SUI) is a unique Layer 1 blockchain and smart contract platform that seeks to enhance digital asset ownership by making it fast, private, and accessible to everyone. The recently launched Grayscale Sui Trust, by the digital asset manager Grayscale, is available to accredited investors for SUI exposure. The bullish news helped SUI achieve a 15.3% gain in one week while BTC had a 0.8% loss during the same time.Book of Meme ($BOME) also saw strong trade demand on Convert last week. This meme coin saw a 73.4% volume increase on Convert and a 4.1% gain last week, outperforming many other meme coins with similar market capitalization.The layer-1 blockchain Cardano ($ADA) was introduced in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum. Its eagerly awaited ""Chang"" update was released on September 1st, completing the ecosystem's long-term shift to decentralized governance. Holders of ADA tokens will be able to influence Cardano's future by choosing governance representatives and approving development ideas thanks to this hard fork update. Last week, ADA had a 7.2% gain due to the bullish sentiment after the upgrade.Overall MarketThe above chart shows the BTC price movement in the 8-hour chart.The BTC price has been trading in this blue downward trend for nearly six months, and it has experienced a significant correction, with a 34% drop from the all-time high of $73,777 to $49,000, a market low caused by the carry trade unwind on August 5. As previously discussed, the $50k/$52k range served as a strong support zone, with the $57k level providing local support. BTC prices tested this again in the $50k/52k range last Friday following the disappointing nonfarm payroll data in the United States, raising market concerns about the US economy and the need for a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed on September 18. Historically, when the Fed lowers interest rates in poor economic conditions, it usually results in a recession within 12 to 18 months.  And we expressed concern that the Fed's 50 basis point rate cut would trigger another round of risk asset sell-offs, pushing the BTC price below the strong support range of 50k/52k. If that scenario unfolds, the current bull cycle will effectively end and become the shortest in BTC history, aside from the 2013 cycle.This week's CPI data suggests that inflation in the United States is moving in the Fed's favour, and the market is now leaning toward a 25 basis point rate cut by the Fed on September 18. The reduced concern about a potential recession in the United States encourages risk-taking. Following the initial reaction to the CPI data, US stocks rallied and recovered all of their losses, closing higher. BTC tracked US equities closely, falling below $55.7k before rising above $57k before the session ended.The FOMC meeting will take place next week, and our desk anticipates some market volatility around the time when Fed Chair Powell delivers his speech after the meeting.Options MarketThe above chart is the 25-delta skewness on BTC options in the last two weeks.A 25-delta skew on options refers to the premium difference between a 25-delta call and a 25-delta put with the same expiry. The negative skew indicates that options traders would prefer to pay a higher premium on puts for downside protection than on calls for upside rewards. It provides a proxy measure for market sentiments by tracking the 25-delta skew across different expirations.As shown in the chart above, front-end BTC options (with a 7-day expiry) have been negative for the last two weeks, with the negative skew further lowering last Friday when BTC was sold below $52.7k. The chart also showed that market sentiment shifted to neutral over the weekend as the Bitcoin price recovered.The skew in medium- to long-term options suggested that options traders were not as bearish as indicated by the front-end options. In the last two weeks, the 60-day, 90-day, and 180-day expired options have all had above-zero skews, while the longer-dated options have maintained steady skews above 0. With the risk backdrop of reduced concern on the US recession and a Fed rate cut on the horizon, risk appetite is encouraged. We anticipate that the skew on BTC options across all durations will rise, indicating some bullish sentiment before/after the FOMC meeting.Macro at a glance Last Thursday (24-09-05)According to ADP nonfarm employment data, the US private market added only 99k new jobs in August, far below analysts' expectations of 144k. The weak ADP data raised market concerns about the US economy's conditions, increasing the likelihood of a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed in September.Last week, the number of initial jobless claims in the United States was 227k, which was lower than the estimated 231k.The S&P Global Services PMI was 55.7 in August, up from the forecasted 55.2.Last Friday (24-09-06)In the United States, nonfarm payrolls (NFP) increased by 142,000 in August, less than 160,000 market expectations. This followed an increase of 89,000 in July, revised from 114,000. The USD index traded volatilely in the Friday session, while US equities fell as concerns about the US economy outweighed risk appetite.The US unemployment rate fell back to 4.2% in August, after hitting 4.3% in July.The unemployment rate in Canada increased to 6.6% in August, exceeding the forecasted 6.5% and July's 6.4%.BTC price experienced a significant sell-off in the Friday US session and found support at 52.5k following an 8% drop.On Monday (24-09-09)The unemployment rate in the UK fell to 4.1% in July from 4.2% in June, meeting economists' expectations.The German CPI fell by 0.1% monthly in August, compared to a 0.3% increase in July. The annualized CPI change was 1.9%, which is lower than the 2.3% increase in July.On Wednesday (24-09-11)The US CPI increased by 0.2% month on month in August, matching the pace seen in July. August saw annualized CPI growth of 2.5%, down from 2.9% in July. However, the monthly core CPI growth rate reaches 0.3%, exceeding the estimated 0.2% and July's 0.2%. The stubborn shelter cost served as the primary driver of the unexpectedly higher core CPI growth.The CPI data released on Wednesday solidified the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week, with an 86% probability. US equities initially lost some ground after the CPI data was released. The market then turned bullish as the Fed's chances of cutting interest rates by 25 basis points increased, and risk assets were bid up. The S&P 500 index finished up 1.07%, while the Nasdaq index rose 2.15%. As a first reaction, the BTC price fell below $55.7k before regaining the $57,000 level by market close.Convert Portal Volume ChangeThe above table shows the volume change on our Convert Portal by zone. Market volatility began to rise in early September, and the BTC price closely tracked US equities. Last Friday after the weak job data in the US, the BTC price fell below $52.7k amid rising concerns about the US economy. The sentiment improved over the weekend, and BTC returned to above $57k on Wednesday.Last week, the Megadrop Zone saw a volume increase of 59.8%. The primary reason for the volume increase was the high demand for BounceBit ($BB).The volume of the Storage zone increased by 14.0% during the same time period. The BitTorrent ($BTTC) demand surge was the primary driver of the volume increase in the Storage zone.In addition, the NFT Zone's volume increased by 4.3%. The change was primarily driven by Mines of Dalarnia ($DAR).Why trade OTC?

2024-09-12,"According to CoinDesk, Bitcoin rose above $58,000 during Asian trading hours on Thursday, driven by a rally in U.S. technology stocks and gains in Asian equity markets. Despite this increase, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows, with Ark Invest’s ARKB seeing a notable $54 million outflow, contributing to a total loss of $43 million after a two-day inflow streak.U.S. inflation data for August supported expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in the coming weeks, as core inflation rose faster than anticipated to more than 0.3%. This economic backdrop saw chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) end the day up 8.2%, while major stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) saw gains as high as 2.13%. These gains extended to Asian markets on Thursday, with stock indices in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan surging.

According to Grayscale, the NAV per share of the Trust is $13.50, with each share containing 14.95 SUI tokens, valuing each Sui token in the trust at 90 cents. Given Sui’s current market value of just over $1, the market appears to be anticipating a Grayscale discount.Elsewhere, AI tokens posted modest gains amid reports that OpenAI is planning to raise $6.5 billion at a valuation of $150 billion.

2024-09-12,"According to BlockBeats, on September 12, CryptoQuant analyst Tarek On-Chain shared insights on social media regarding the current trends in Bitcoin reserves on exchanges. He noted that Bitcoin reserves on exchanges are significantly decreasing, a trend that typically signals a price increase. The reduction in Bitcoin reserves on exchanges implies a decrease in selling pressure as investors move their Bitcoin to cold wallets, reducing the available supply in the market. Historically, such transfers have often been accompanied by price peaks, suggesting a similar situation might be unfolding now.At the same time, the reserves of stablecoins on exchanges are increasing, indicating that investors are preparing to enter the market. Stablecoins represent capital that can be deployed at any moment, and their increasing reserves suggest that traders are waiting for the right opportunity to enter the market. This growth indicates a strong buying intention within the market.Decreasing Bitcoin reserves and increasing stablecoin reserves sets the stage for a potential price surge. With the supply of Bitcoin decreasing and purchasing power increasing, the market is poised for an upward trend. Historically, such supply-demand imbalances have often led to significant price increases.The decrease in Bitcoin reserves coupled with the increase in stablecoin reserves suggests a bullish outlook for Bitcoin.

2024-09-11,"According to BlockBeats, an analysis published by Coindesk on September 11 reveals that Bitcoin's weekly MACD has been negative since April, occasionally signaling the strongest bearish trend since 2022. However, Bitcoin's price has remained within a slightly downward-sloping channel between $50,000 and $70,000, forming a 'bull flag' pattern rather than a sharp decline, which contradicts the ongoing MACD signal. Global chart pattern expert Thomas N. Bulkowski typically defines a 'bull flag' pattern as a consolidation period characterized by a slightly downward-sloping channel following a steep upward trend. This pattern usually precedes a rise to higher levels, continuing the previous upward trend. Indicator data shows that since late April, the MACD has consistently been bearish. Combined with the flag price pattern, this suggests underlying bullish sentiment beneath the surface price action. This indicates that sellers have failed to establish a strong downward trend, even during the panic sell-off in early August, which only suppressed the price to between $55,000 and $50,000. The prolonged weakness of sellers implies that a sudden bull market resurgence and price increase may be imminent.","Bitcoin's weekly MACD has been negative since April.

2024-09-11,"According to Odaily, Udi Wertheimer, an advocate of OP_CAT and co-founder of Taproot Wizards, recently expressed on social media that the user experience of BRC-20 and Runes has been disappointing for most cryptocurrency enthusiasts. He noted that Bitcoin consensus, including nodes and miners, does not recognize their existence. Wertheimer introduced a new Bitcoin-native token protocol called CATNIP, based on OP_CAT recursive contracts, which aims to address these issues. CATNIP allows for partial order fulfillment in the market, enabling users to purchase the exact amount of tokens they need without pre-splitting UTXOs. It also supports bidding, where users can specify the amount of CATNIP they wish to buy at a certain BTC price, allowing one or more sellers to complete the transaction. This protocol will even enable on-chain L1 AMM and liquidity pools. However, due to Bitcoin's slow block times and other issues related to transaction relay strategies, Wertheimer believes that L1 AMM will not provide a good experience. Nonetheless, CATNIP will also support fast and secure off-chain AMM, such as using CatVM. CATNIP is currently under development and testing. The team plans to launch the protocol when OP_CAT goes live on the Bitcoin mainnet.","The user experience of BRC-20 and Runes has been disappointing for most cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

Popular crypto analyst Mags suggests that Bitcoin could experience a final dip before a substantial upward movement. Mags noted in a Sept. 9 post that Bitcoin has been forming higher highs and higher lows since February 2024, indicating a long-term uptrend. However, chart patterns suggest a potential correction toward the $51,000 trendline before the next leg up. Additionally, Bitcoin Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap analysis points to a possible correction to $54,000, based on the current BTC CME gap between $54,000 and $54,450. CME gap analysis has become a popular method for evaluating potential retest areas for Bitcoin during momentum breakouts. These gaps are often marked by traders as potential support and resistance ranges before trend continuation or reversal.

Titan of Crypto mentioned in a Sept. 10 post that it might be time for Bitcoin to end its consolidation phase, noting that while history doesn't always repeat itself, it often rhymes. October is seen as a ripe month for Bitcoin's final bullish cycle to commence, according to Titan of Crypto. The analyst highlighted in a Sept. 4 post that October could mark the beginning of Bitcoin's final cycle move. Historical data supports this view, as October has been the second-best month for Bitcoin price action, with an average return of 22.9%, while November remains the best month with average historical returns of 46.81%, according to CoinGlass data.

2024-09-10,"According to CoinDesk, a solo bitcoin miner successfully mined block 860749 on Tuesday, earning a reward of $181,000. This event is notable as bitcoin mining is typically dominated by larger mining pools, such as FoundryUSA and Antpool, which together represent more than 50% of the total hash rate. Bitcoin blocks are produced approximately every 30 minutes, and the reward for successfully mining a block currently stands at 3.125 bitcoin, following a recent halving event earlier this year. Solo miners generally have limited computing power compared to large mining pools, although new solo mining rigs like BitAxe claim to offer 500 Giga Hashes per second (GH/s). Despite this, a solo miner winning a block is akin to winning a lottery, given the network's all-time high hashrate and difficulty, along with competition from institutional miners with immense computing power. Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, explained that while it is not rare for a solo miner to find a block, it remains a low probability event. He noted that the production of small ASICs (mining equipment) has increased, allowing more individuals to mine from home. Despite the occasional success of solo miners, the mining pool space remains highly concentrated. FoundryUSA and Antpool alone account for 53% of the total Bitcoin network hashrate. According to Hashrate Index, FoundryUSA has a reported hash rate of 202.8 exahashes per second (EH/s), while Antpool has a hash rate of 160.3 EH/s.

2024-09-09,"According to The Block: Bitcoin continues to trade below $55,000, and Ether is struggling to break $2,300 after disappointing U.S. non-farm payroll (NFP) data.

These minor gains come after Friday’s release of NFP data, which showed U.S. job growth at 142,000 in August, below expectations of 160,000.Impact of the U.S. Economic DataThe NFP figures are a critical measure of the U.S. economy’s employment and inflation status, influencing market sentiment across various sectors. Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SOFA.org, commented that the data hurt crypto markets. He noted, “Crypto would need a near-perfect mix of NFP outcomes to see higher prices. Instead, we received one of the worst-case outcomes as the repricing of risk sentiment dragged BTC and ETH down.”On the same day, Bitcoin briefly dropped to lows of $52,850, and Ether dipped to $2,160. While the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 4.2%, helping to ease concerns about an imminent recession, the weaker payroll data weighed more heavily on investor sentiment.Looking Ahead: Key Events to WatchWith more U.S. inflation data expected this week and the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, volatility is likely to continue in the crypto market. Metalpha's senior analyst, Lucy Hu, explained, “The coming week might see more risk reduction with a lack of positive catalysts on the horizon.”Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve's next meeting, scheduled for Sept. 17-18, will be a significant event, especially as investors await potential changes in interest rates.

2024-09-09,"According to Odaily, Pierre Rochard, Vice President of Research at Riot Platforms, highlighted that in Texas, excess electricity production has occasionally driven prices down to zero. Bitcoin miners have been able to absorb this surplus energy, effectively stabilizing the power grid. This analysis comes amid ongoing criticism of Bitcoin mining for its energy consumption and environmental impact. However, it also offers significant benefits, particularly in terms of grid stability and energy efficiency. A key advantage is that Bitcoin miners can quickly turn their mining equipment on and off, responding to fluctuations in energy demand. In related news, Agile Energy X, a subsidiary of Tokyo Electric Power Grid, announced earlier today that it has begun installing Bitcoin mining equipment next to solar power plants in Tochigi and Gunma prefectures. This initiative aims to utilize surplus renewable energy for mining experiments. If 10% of this energy is used for Bitcoin mining, it is expected to generate approximately 360 billion yen (2.5 billion USD) in annual revenue. This move seeks to address the issue of power wastage due to the volatility of renewable energy generation while supporting Japan's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.","In Texas, excess electricity production has been able to absorb the surplus energy, effectively stabilizing the power grid.

2024-09-09,"According to Bloomberg: US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have experienced their longest run of daily net outflows since their launch earlier this year. Investors withdrew nearly $1.2 billion from the 12 Bitcoin ETFs over the eight days leading up to Sept. 6. This decline is part of a broader retreat from riskier assets as global markets face economic uncertainty.Factors Driving the OutflowsThe challenging market environment, fueled by mixed US jobs data and deflationary pressure in China, is having a significant impact on traders. As the short-term correlation between stocks and cryptocurrencies strengthens, Bitcoin's price movements have become more closely aligned with fluctuations in equity markets.Bitcoin has struggled in September, losing around 7%, although the digital asset saw a modest 1% increase to $54,870 by Monday afternoon in Singapore. Sean McNulty, director of trading at Arbelos Markets, noted that the recent uptick may be partially attributed to prominent influencers closing their short positions, citing BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes as an example.Political and Economic ImpactThe political climate is also influencing market sentiment. An improved showing by pro-crypto Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in polls and prediction markets could be contributing to Bitcoin's small relief rally. McNulty reported increased demand for options hedges ahead of Tuesday’s debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, who has yet to clarify her stance on cryptocurrencies.The original US Bitcoin ETFs debuted in January 2024 with strong demand, driving Bitcoin to a record high of $73,798 in March.

Despite the broader market's sluggish activity, analysts at Presto Research believe Bitcoin is currently undervalued.In a Monday note, Peter Chung and Min Jung from Presto Research stated that Bitcoin’s record-high network security makes it an attractive investment. “The hashrate, or computational power securing the Bitcoin network, has hit an all-time high of 679 EH/s, making it the most secure network by far,” they noted, adding that, “BTC seems grossly undervalued at the moment.”Macroeconomic Factors Impacting BTCBitcoin miners have been expanding capacity since August, and this increase in hashrate typically marks a price bottom for the asset.

Bianco, the CEO of Bianco Research, expressed in a Sept. 8 post that spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs have not lived up to the pre-approval hype since their launch in January.Source: Jim BiancoHe pointed to recent outflows, holders losing on their positions, and a lack of major institutional investment as indicators that the Bitcoin ETF market might need more time to mature.Bianco highlighted that there has been over $1 billion in net outflows from the 11 US Bitcoin ETFs in the last eight trading days, according to Farside Investors data. The spot Bitcoin ETF market now holds around $48 billion in assets under management, down from its peak of $61 billion in March.

Unlike cash ATMs, which might go unnoticed in a gas station, Bitcoin ATMs attract more attention from criminals.Timothy Bates, a cybersecurity professor at the University of Michigan's School of Innovation and Technology, stated that these machines are particularly vulnerable to both physical and cyber threats, making them a primary target for hackers and thieves.

Its CEO, Brandon Mintz, mentioned that their machines are designed to prevent hacking but questioned the notion that Bitcoin ATMs are a major target for cybercriminals.Mintz explained that because the hardware and Bitcoin wallet environments are separate, Bitcoin ATMs are generally not a high-priority target for cybercriminals.

The actual prices of options are formed through competition among numerous options traders. Therefore, implied volatility represents the market participants' views and expectations for the future of the market, making it the closest approximation to the real-time volatility at that moment.","The BitVol (Bitcoin Volatility) Index fell to 61.51 on September 8th, marking a daily decrease of 0.79%.

2024-09-07,"According to Cointelegraph, El Salvador is celebrating the third anniversary of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, a move that made it the first country in the world to do so on September 7, 2021. The initiative aimed to promote financial inclusion, streamline remittance payments, and attract financial innovation. President Nayib Bukele's decision to adopt Bitcoin has positioned El Salvador as a pioneer in the digital asset space. Alex Momot, founder and CEO of Peanut Trade crypto trading platform, remarked that while it is too early to declare the initiative a complete success, the country has certainly reaped some benefits. El Salvador has been dollar-cost-averaging into Bitcoin since 2021, purchasing one Bitcoin per day. As of now, the country's Bitcoin holdings have generated over $31 million in profit, according to the Nayib Bukele Portfolio Tracker website. The average buying price for El Salvador's Bitcoin was $43,877 per BTC, which is currently trading at $54,300. Momot highlighted that the financial gain strengthens Bukele's position, adding credibility to his bold cryptocurrency experiment. El Salvador currently holds a total of 5,865 Bitcoin, valued at over $318 million, according to the country's treasury website. Despite initial criticism, especially after Bitcoin's price fell from its all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021 to as low as $16,000 during the bear market, the country has managed to turn a profit. While El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin has been closely watched, only one other country, the Central African Republic, has followed suit, adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in April 2022. Larger economies have remained hesitant, likely due to their dependence on relationships with international creditors who oppose such moves. Brazilian lawmakers have shown interest in establishing a legal framework for Bitcoin adoption, but concrete regulations have yet to be developed.","El Salvador is celebrating the third anniversary of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender on September 7, 2021.

2024-09-07,"According to 10x Research: Bitcoin is experiencing a significant downturn, but the signs were evident in the data, making this crash neither unexpected nor without cause. Here's a breakdown of what's driving Bitcoin's latest price correction and what to expect moving forward.Macroeconomic Data Signals CorrectionUnderstanding Market Events: The current Bitcoin crash emphasizes the importance of paying attention to macroeconomic data and its impact on crypto markets. Bitcoin is highly sensitive to shifts in the economy, and positioning around these events has become crucial for traders.Bitcoin’s Strategic Rebuy Zone: On-chain data suggests that Bitcoin's price correction is linked to new wallet activity and long-term holders exiting at high prices. A key signal for Bitcoin to become attractively priced again may be a drop into the $30,000 range.Breaking Support LevelsOn-Chain Data Trends: New Bitcoin addresses peaked in November 2023 and have sharply declined since. As short-term holders sold off their positions, long-term holders capitalized on high prices, signaling a market top. With increasing unrealized losses, Bitcoin is vulnerable to deeper corrections.Macroeconomic Indicators: The ISM Manufacturing Index, a leading economic indicator, confirms a cyclical peak for risk assets like Bitcoin. The Nasdaq and Bitcoin both reacted negatively to recent weak ISM prints, showing that economic indicators are driving Bitcoin’s repricing.Weakness Across SectorsBroader Economic Weakness: As the U.S. economy shows signs of weakness, DeFi and meme coin markets are also slowing down. The Ethereum network has seen a sharp revenue decline, supported by a downturn in DEX and meme coin trading. This broader slowdown is impacting both Ethereum and Solana, leading to further price corrections.Impact on Ether and Futures: Ether became highly vulnerable after the SEC hinted at ETH ETF approvals, leading futures traders to take long positions. When expectations weren’t met, Ether crashed in August, causing massive losses among traders and diminishing the appetite for risk.Bitcoin Spot ETF InfluenceETF Buyer Behavior: The hype surrounding Bitcoin Spot ETFs was a key factor driving high funding rates, which in turn fueled the self-reinforcing price cycle. Despite inflows of $17 billion into Bitcoin ETFs, these investors are now facing $2 billion in losses as Bitcoin’s price corrects. ETF outflows are signaling that many investors are exiting their positions.A Divergence from Gold: Bitcoin was marketed as ""digital gold,"" but unlike physical gold, which remains near all-time highs, Bitcoin has corrected like a typical risk asset. The demand for Bitcoin Spot ETFs has slowed, creating further downside pressure.The Future of BitcoinTopping Formation and Liquidations: Bitcoin’s topping pattern is playing out in a precise sequence. As new wallet growth slows and futures traders face liquidations, Bitcoin is increasingly behaving like a risk asset. This dynamic is likely to push Bitcoin prices down to $45,000 in the near term.In conclusion, Bitcoin's recent crash can be attributed to a combination of macroeconomic factors, weak market flows, and on-chain data trends. Traders who stay informed and strategically position themselves around key data events may find opportunities to capitalize on future market shifts","Bitcoin is experiencing a significant downturn.

2024-09-06,"According to Cointelegraph, a new report from Bitcoin technology and financial services firm River forecasts that some companies in the United States will increase their exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) over the next 18 months. The report estimates that around 10% of US-based companies are likely to convert 1.5% of their treasury reserves, approximately $10.35 billion, to Bitcoin within this period.River's analysts highlighted that traditional corporate treasury strategies, which rely on cash and other short-term cash equivalents, are poor stores of value. These investments can generate modest returns near the federal funds rate, currently over 5%. However, even these short-term investments often fail to outperform inflation, diminishing the value of a treasury. The report noted that this inflationary erosion caused Apple, now a trillion-dollar corporation, to lose $15 billion of its treasury holdings over the last decade.The forecast points to the growing adoption of a corporate treasury strategy popularized by MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor. In June 2024, MicroStrategy completed an additional $800 million debt sale of senior convertible notes at 2.25%, with a maturation date of 2032. The company used the funds from the corporate debt to purchase an additional 11,931 BTC. Saylor has characterized Bitcoin as an asset that guarantees “economic immortality” to corporations and businesses due to its capped supply and a lack of counterparty risk inherent in other stores of value, such as real estate or equities.MicroStrategy’s second-quarter earnings report revealed that it currently holds 226,500 BTC, valued at approximately $14.7 billion at the time. Saylor’s BTC treasury strategy has caused MicroStrategy to significantly outperform Warren Buffett’s investment company, Berkshire Hathaway. Since adopting the Bitcoin treasury strategy, MicroStrategy has risen by over 1,000%, while shares of Berkshire Hathaway rose by 104.75% during the same period. Buffett has declined to add Bitcoin to his portfolio or recommend it as a hedge against fiat inflation.","10% of US-based companies are likely to convert 1.5% of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin over the next 18 months.

2024-09-06,"According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin's (BTC) price is experiencing bearish pressure as the total cryptocurrency market cap drops below $2 trillion. The crypto fear and greed index indicates 'extreme fear' in the market, a sentiment not seen since early August. Bitcoin recently hit a monthly low of $55,250 on September 6, testing an untouched demand zone from August. On the 1-hour chart, Bitcoin could potentially swing high toward $57,500, supported by a bullish divergence between the price and the relative strength index (RSI). Each swing low on the hourly chart has seen an average recovery of around 4% in September, which translates to a price range of $57,500 to $58,000. At $57,500, upside liquidation leverage positions are present, and day traders might view this as a short opportunity. A daily close below $55,000 could lead to further downside for BTC in the coming days, with a potential retest around $52,100. Axel Adler Jr., a Bitcoin researcher, notes that this is the 'next closest target' as it represents the current realized price of short-term holders. The range between $50,500 and $53,000 is marked by significant whale accumulations from February 2024. If Bitcoin fails to hold the $52,000 level, $49,000 is expected to be the final support price, putting its long-term bullish structure under serious bearish pressure. Similar to the last bull run in 2021, Bitcoin may retest the 50-weekly EMA if it drops to $49,000. Bitcoin has not closed a weekly candle below the 50-weekly EMA since October 2023. In 2021, the 50-weekly EMA provided support before the second leg of the rally, and the RSI reset around the 50 level. A similar reset is occurring now, and if the price action repeats, Bitcoin should avoid prolonged consolidation under $50,000 to prevent a weekly close below the key EMA level.

2024-09-05,"According to Cointelegraph, Fractal Bitcoin, a sidechain scaling solution for Bitcoin (BTC) using the Bitcoin core code, presents a dual-edged opportunity for miners. This solution, which is merge-mined alongside Bitcoin, allows miners to use the same hardware to mine both Bitcoin and Fractal Bitcoin simultaneously. This could potentially enhance miner profits in the post-halving environment without the need for retooling facilities for AI or high-performance computing. However, the introduction of Fractal Bitcoin also poses a risk to miner revenues. By supporting the BRC-20 token standard and offering a faster, cheaper scaling solution for the Bitcoin base layer, Fractal Bitcoin could reduce network fees generated by the demand for non-fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network, thereby decreasing miner profits. Despite a decline in the initial hype around Bitcoin Runes, ordinals, BRC-20 tokens, and inscriptions, these tokenized assets continue to provide a significant source of revenue for Bitcoin miners. Following the halving event in April 2024, the minting of Bitcoin Runes contributed 1,200 BTC in network fees to miners by the end of that month, initially offsetting the decreased block subsidy. Since then, Bitcoin Runes have generated approximately $162.4 million in fees, excluding other tokenized assets on the Bitcoin network. The potential success of Fractal Bitcoin and other Bitcoin layer-2 solutions could mirror the revenue collapse experienced by Ethereum's layer-1 network. Since the launch of the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, which significantly reduced fees for Ethereum’s layer-2 transactions, Ethereum network fees have steadily declined. This reduction led to a surge in Ethereum layer-2 networks and increased competition to offer the fastest and cheapest scaling solutions. Consequently, fees on the Ethereum base layer have plummeted by 99% since the Dencun upgrade went live earlier this year.","Fractal Bitcoin is a sidechain scaling solution for Bitcoin (BTC) using the Bitcoin core code.

This shift reflects a broader trend of investors moving away from alternative cryptocurrencies and gravitating towards bitcoin. The introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to ether prices in the U.S. in late July provided a new avenue for investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without the need for direct storage.

2024-09-05,"According to Cointelegraph, the total capital in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols could surpass that of the Ethereum network within the next two years, as stated by Branden Sedo, an initial contributor at Bitcoin sidechain Core DAO. Speaking at Korea Blockchain Week, Sedo highlighted that the trillion dollars currently held in the Bitcoin ecosystem will gradually move on-chain, potentially overtaking Ethereum's network. He emphasized that Bitcoin's increasing value and the influx of institutional capital through exchange-traded products (ETPs) could drive this shift. Sedo noted that solutions like trustless bridges and roll-ups could facilitate the movement of capital on-chain, creating more opportunities for Bitcoin. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year has spurred development activity and market enthusiasm for Bitcoin sidechains, including Core, Bitlayer, and Stacks. However, Sedo acknowledged that for Bitcoin’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) to surpass Ethereum’s, more Bitcoin holders need to become comfortable with using their Bitcoin in DeFi applications. The collapse of platforms like BlockFi and Celsius in 2022 has made many Bitcoiners wary of yield-bearing avenues, preferring to hold their Bitcoin in cold wallets. Despite this skepticism, Sedo has observed a shift in attitude among Bitcoiners, particularly towards non-custodial DeFi applications. After attending the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Sedo noted a builder-centric vibe and excitement about the potential of the Bitcoin network. Sedo expressed confidence in Core’s non-custodial staking approach and its bridge powered by LayerZero, a major bridging protocol that has not experienced significant exploits. Core Chain allows users to time lock their Bitcoin, earning a 3% yield paid in CORE tokens, which are used for gas and governance on the network. Core recently surpassed Bitlayer to become the largest Bitcoin sidechain, with $314.4 million in TVL and 5,541 BTC staked on its network. At the time of publication, Core accounts for 26.4% of the total TVL across all Bitcoin sidechains, according to DeFiLlama data.","The total capital in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols could surpass that of the Ethereum network within the next two years.

2024-09-04,"According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin mining companies are exploring diversification into data centers to enhance revenue. However, Phil Harvey, CEO of blockchain data center consulting firm Sabre56, argues that this shift to high-performance computing is impractical due to significant cost differences and logistical challenges. Harvey highlighted that operating an AI or high-performance data center is far more expensive than running a crypto mining facility. He noted that a typical commercial mining operation costs between $300,000 and $350,000 per megawatt, whereas AI data centers require between $3 million and $5 million per megawatt—a 10-15x increase. Additionally, a mining operation with a gigawatt of available power can only convert approximately 200 megawatts for high-performance computing needs. The CEO emphasized that only about 20% of a miner's portfolio could potentially support the necessary attributes like power, data, and land for AI. He also pointed out the significant physical space requirements, with crypto mining needing 1,000 square feet per megawatt compared to 5,000 square feet per megawatt for AI or HPC data centers. Furthermore, converting crypto mining facilities to AI and high-performance data centers involves substantial upfront costs, with over 90% of existing infrastructure needing replacement. Bitcoin miners are seeking alternative revenue streams due to decreased block subsidies and reduced revenues, which hit an 11-month low in August. The idea of shifting to AI data centers and high-performance computing has been proposed, raising concerns about energy resource allocation between the emerging AI industry and crypto mining. A report by VanEck suggested that Bitcoin mining companies could potentially earn $13.9 billion in annual revenues if they allocate 20% of their output to AI data processing and high-performance computing. However, the practical challenges and significant costs involved in such a transition make it a complex and potentially unfeasible solution for many mining companies.",Bitcoin mining companies are considering shifting to AI data centers and high-performance computing to boost their revenue.

2024-09-04,"According to CoinDesk, as the cryptocurrency market reaches new heights, led by assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, investors are increasingly focused on optimizing their portfolios. While the growth potential of these major cryptocurrencies is evident, the challenge in this maturing market is the hunt for yield, especially for Bitcoin holders and those seeking effective collateral options.Bitcoin’s primary appeal has always been its potential for significant capital appreciation. However, unlike Ethereum and Solana, which offer staking rewards, Bitcoin lacks a straightforward method for generating yield. Traditionally, investors have resorted to lending their Bitcoin to earn interest. This approach carried significant risks, particularly due to rehypothecation, where assets were used as collateral for further lending. This practice led to a credit bubble that burst in 2022, resulting in widespread insolvencies and a loss of trust in many facets of the market.The fallout from the 2022 crisis has pushed the industry to innovate. One of the most promising developments has been the rise of tokenized money market funds. These funds offer a way to generate yield with the speed and efficiency of crypto combined with the safety of government-backed Treasury bills. Unlike stablecoins, which are also backed by similar assets but often fail to provide yield, tokenized money market funds offer an efficient option for collateral and margining purposes, aligning with the needs of investors seeking both yield and safety.In addition to these funds, some of the top digital asset managers have devised strategies to generate yield on long Bitcoin positions without the need for lending. By entering into carefully selected derivatives structures, investors can earn options-yield while retaining segregated custody of their assets and without sacrificing upside. This approach addresses the dual challenge of income generation and asset security, offering a viable alternative for long-term holders who have traditionally relied on buy-and-hold strategies.The hunt for yield in crypto is evolving. As the market matures, integrating yield-generating mechanisms like tokenized money market funds and secure options vaults will likely become essential for professional portfolios. These innovations represent a new frontier in crypto investment, where the focus is not just on capital appreciation but also on generating steady, reliable income. For investors, this marks a significant shift—one that could redefine the role of crypto in diversified portfolios.","As the cryptocurrency market matures, investors are looking for yield-generating methods to improve their portfolios.

Similar to physical gold, Bitcoin serves as an alternative currency system competing with the dollar in the international market.

Therefore, investors should closely monitor upcoming labor market data, including the next monthly employment report scheduled for release on September 6.

2024-09-04,"According to CoinDesk, Bitcoin mining profitability has reached a record low, as reported by JPMorgan in a recent research report. The aggregate market capitalization of U.S.-listed Bitcoin miners tracked by the bank fell by 15% last month. The report highlighted that mining difficulty increased by 9% from the previous month.JPMorgan analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce noted that Bitcoin miners earned an average of $43,600 per exahash per second (EH/s) in daily block reward revenue in August, marking the lowest point on record. This is a significant drop from the peak value of $342,000 in November 2021, when Bitcoin's price was $60,000 and the network hash rate was 161 EH/s.The decline in mining stocks was attributed to the falling average price of Bitcoin for the third consecutive month and the rising network hash rate.

Despite the decline in whale activity over the past six months, long-term accumulation by whale addresses remains relatively high.Meanwhile, data from Intotheblock shows that Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC comprise the largest share of the total Bitcoin supply at 24.17%. Addresses holding between 10 and 100 BTC and 100 and 1,000 BTC also account for significant portions of the supply, at 22.08% and 20.32%, respectively.

The Supply per Whale metric, created by Charles Edwards, measures the accumulation and distribution behavior of large Bitcoin holders. It is defined as the total supply owned by addresses holding 100 to 10,000 BTC, divided by the address count. This metric increases when whales accumulate and decreases during distribution events.

2024-09-03,"According to Cointelegraph, Scottish prosecutors have seized 23.5 Bitcoin from a man involved in a 2020 robbery, marking the first instance of cryptocurrency seizure in the country. The robbery, which took place near Glasgow, involved three men armed with a machete and a Toblerone chocolate bar breaking into a home. This case, initially heard last year, was notable for being the first in Scotland to involve tracing stolen cryptocurrency, according to Detective Inspector Craig Potter from Police Scotland’s Cyber Investigations unit.In a groundbreaking move, prosecutors utilized proceeds of crime legislation to seize and convert the stolen Bitcoin into cash. The court proceedings revealed that the home invasion occurred in Blantyre, southeast of Glasgow, where one of the intruders repeatedly beat a woman with a personalized Toblerone bar and threw her into a bedroom. The victim, who remains unnamed for legal reasons, testified that he awoke to find a man standing over him with a machete, forcing him to transfer Bitcoin. The assailant then made a throat-slitting gesture with the bloodied Toblerone bar before fleeing with the other two men.Lawyers at Edinburgh’s High Court agreed on Sept. 3 to convert the 23.5 BTC into cash, amounting to 109,601 British pounds, or approximately $144,017 US dollars. This sum reflects the value of Bitcoin at the time of the robbery in March 2020, when it was trading at around $5,400. Since then, the price of Bitcoin has surged nearly 1,000%.The Bitcoin was seized from John Ross Rennie, who was convicted of possessing stolen goods in November. Prosecutors identified Rennie as the “technical brains” behind the raid, although he denied involvement, claiming a relative forced him to deposit the Bitcoin in an exchange account. However, Edinburgh High Court judge Lord Scott emphasized Rennie’s pivotal role in instructing how to transfer the Bitcoin. As part of his conviction, Rennie was sentenced to 150 hours of unpaid work and a six-month supervision order.","Scottish prosecutors have seized 23.5 Bitcoin from a thief involved in a 2020 robbery near Glasgow.

2024-09-02,"According to CoinDesk, Bitcoin fell nearly 1.2% to around $57,500 on the Labor Day holiday in the U.S., with other cryptocurrencies like Solana and Dogecoin experiencing losses up to 5%. This decline extends Bitcoin's seven-day drop to over 10%, reflecting a broader downturn in the crypto market. Market analysis indicates a historically bearish trend for September, with Bitcoin typically seeing a monthly decline of 6% on average. Major cryptocurrencies such as Solana, BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP, and Cardano’s ADA fell as much as 3%, while Dogecoin led the losses among the largest cryptocurrencies with a 5% drop. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the largest tokens, fell 1.88%. U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Bitcoin posted total net outflows of $175 million on Friday, marking a four-day losing streak. Ether ETFs had zero net inflows or outflows despite $173 million in trading volume. Traditional markets in the U.S. remained closed due to the Labor Day holiday. Some traders noted that Bitcoin's loss aligns with the bearish seasonality observed in September. However, they suggested that potential interest-rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve could alter this trend. Innokenty Isers, founder of crypto exchange Paybis, mentioned that September is historically a negative month for Bitcoin, with an average value depletion rate of 6.56%. He added that if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in September, it might help Bitcoin overcome its negative trend, as rate cuts generally lead to an increased flow of U.S. dollars in the economy, strengthening Bitcoin's outlook as a store of value. Seasonality refers to the tendency of assets to experience regular and predictable changes throughout the calendar year. While these changes may appear random, they can be attributed to factors such as profit-taking around tax season in April and May, which causes drawdowns, and the generally bullish 'Santa Claus' rally in December, indicating increased demand. Isers also noted that macroeconomic indices, spot Bitcoin ETF adoption, and favorable hashrate might make September a relatively better month for Bitcoin this quarter.","Bitcoin fell nearly 1.2% to around $57,500 on the Labor Day holiday in the U.S., with other cryptocurrencies like Solana and Dogecoin experiencing losses up to 5%.

2024-08-31,"According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin mining firm Rhodium Enterprises, which recently filed for bankruptcy, has received court approval to take a loan in either United States dollars or Bitcoin. The company has been authorized to choose between receiving $30 million or 500 Bitcoin from Galaxy Digital, a blockchain firm led by Mike Novogratz. The dollar loan would carry a 14.5% annual interest rate, while the Bitcoin loan would have a lower interest rate of 9.5%, according to a Bloomberg report. With the lender’s approval, Rhodium could repay the Bitcoin loan in US dollars based on the “reasonable published market spot prices” at the time of repayment, prior to the due date. The approval is unusual for bankruptcy financing in the crypto sector due to Bitcoin’s price volatility, which makes it challenging to predict the total amount of loan payments, regardless of the interest rate. On Aug. 24, Rhodium Enterprises filed for voluntary bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, disclosing liabilities of up to $100 million. The filing included six subsidiaries — Rhodium Encore, Jordan HPC, Rhodium JV, Rhodium 2.0, Rhodium 10MW, and Rhodium 30MW. According to the document, the company’s debts range between $50 million and $100 million, while its total assets are valued between $100 million and $500 million. By filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy voluntarily, the company can reorganize its debts while continuing to operate. This allows it to negotiate a revised repayment plan under new terms. Bitcoin mining firms have been facing significant pressure due to reduced mining rewards following the Bitcoin halving in April. Additionally, concerns have arisen over their mounting debt and previous mismanagement. “Cash-rich miners like Riot Platforms and Cleanspark acquired other miners with turn-key facilities to increase near-term hashrate and increase their power pipeline,” said JPMorgan in a recent report. Capital-constrained miners like IREN and Cipher focused on securing greenfield opportunities, which require less immediate capital, the report added.

2024-08-31,"According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin's next move must print a bullish 'higher high' on the price chart to keep its uptrend intact after recently dropping below $58,000, as per crypto analyst Matthew Hyland. Hyland emphasized the importance of Bitcoin bouncing back and making a higher high to confirm the ongoing uptrend since August. He noted that Bitcoin must stay above the $57.7K level and, if it breaks down, it must hold the $56K level to avoid a lower low. However, some traders believe Bitcoin needs to drop further before resuming its uptrend. Markus Thielen, head of Research at 10x Research, suggested waiting for Bitcoin's price to fall into the low $40,000s for an ideal entry into the bull market.

2024-08-30,"According to Cointelegraph, a new peer-reviewed scientific paper titled 'An Integrated Landfill Gas-to-Energy and Bitcoin Mining Framework,' published in the Aug. 29 edition of the Journal of Cleaner Production, has demonstrated how Bitcoin (BTC) mining could play a significant role in reducing methane emissions. The research highlights how Bitcoin miners can leverage 'Landfill Gas to Energy' (LFGTE) systems to capture and convert methane gas from landfills into usable energy, thereby sequestering the greenhouse gas and mitigating its harmful effects on the atmosphere. The paper argues that Bitcoin mining offers the proper incentive structure for such capital-intensive, long-term projects, which other private enterprises often lack due to the absence of sustainable revenue generation and cost recovery strategies. The researchers stated, 'Bitcoin’s economic incentives, available globally for miners in any location, may offer an innovative solution for encouraging methane mitigation without the need for government incentives—presenting a scalable and novel solution for rapid deployment.' They also noted that this incentive structure could be applied to other underutilized energy sources, such as orphaned oil and gas wells, wastewater treatment plants, farms, and agricultural processing operations. In 2023, Marathon Digital, formerly known as MARA, partnered with Nodal Power to mine Bitcoin using methane gas in Utah. At the time of the 280-kilowatt initiative's announcement, MARA Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel stated, 'At Marathon, we are constantly seeking innovative ways to diversify our operations, lower our energy costs, and leverage the unique aspects of Bitcoin mining to better the environments in which we operate.' In May 2024, the company furthered this mission by signing a deal with the Kenyan government to develop renewable energy infrastructure within the country. The findings of the recent paper are corroborated by other research. In 2023, a study published by the Institute of Risk Management found that Bitcoin mining operations could reduce global emissions by around 8% by 2030.","Bitcoin mining can reduce methane emissions by 8% by 2030.

2024-08-30,"According to Cointelegraph, long-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders often encounter challenges when trying to use their wealth to secure financing. Adam Reeds, CEO and co-founder of Ledn, a company specializing in Bitcoin lending services, discussed how Bitcoin collateralized loans can enhance the velocity of money and capital. Reeds highlighted that many early Bitcoin adopters are reluctant to sell their BTC to access liquidity and often find it difficult to secure loans from traditional financial institutions, which may not recognize Bitcoin holdings as collateral. This situation keeps the collateral locked up and unproductive in the broader economy. The solution, according to Reeds, is to utilize Bitcoin collateral by borrowing against it. This allows Bitcoin holders to access fiat-denominated liquidity for various purposes, such as financing a business, consumer spending, real estate, or even acquiring more BTC. Bitcoin loans are highly efficient, enabling borrowers to secure financing within days, unlike the weeks or months typically required by traditional institutions. Reeds emphasized the soundness of Bitcoin as collateral, agreeing with Michael Saylor's view that Bitcoin is a thermodynamically sound asset class, free from the physical depreciation that affects many other asset types. He stated that lending against Bitcoin is a lower-risk activity compared to lending against real estate or equities, as Bitcoin lacks GAAP risk. Reeds also noted that Bitcoin is not subject to counterparty risks such as false media reports, fake whistleblower accounts, and bad press, which can negatively impact the price of a business or equity. Reeds also addressed the lack of banking infrastructure and adequate financial services in some parts of the world. He suggested that Bitcoin-collateralized loans could provide financial opportunities for the unbanked and those living in high-inflation environments. Examples include Argentina, with a 276% annual inflation rate, and Nigeria, which has an unbanked population of 38 million residents.","Adam Reeds is the CEO and co-founder of Ledn, a company specializing in Bitcoin lending services.

2024-08-30,"According to CoinDesk: Bitcoin (BTC) attempted to regain momentum once again during Thursday's U.S. trading session, with the price falling below $59,000 after briefly climbing above $61,000. Despite the dip, BTC managed to hold onto a 0.6% gain over the past 24 hours, in line with the broader market, as reflected by the CoinDesk 20 Index. However, Ether (ETH) faced slight pressure, down 0.5%, just above the $2,500 mark.The day’s most significant losses were seen in artificial intelligence-focused cryptocurrencies, which tumbled following a sharp decline in Nvidia's (NVDA) stock. Nvidia, a leading chipmaker, saw its shares drop by 6.4% after releasing its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday evening. This decline weighed heavily on AI-related tokens, with Render (RNDR), Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), and Bittensor (TAO) all falling between 7% and 10%. U.S. equities also struggled, with early gains evaporating by late afternoon. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the retreat, dropping 0.3% after being up more than 1.5% earlier in the day.Crypto bulls needed to push Bitcoin’s price past $61,000—above critical short-term moving averages on the 4-hour chart—to have a meaningful chance of rallying toward the upper end of its recent range. The current price action suggests that the crypto market is likely headed for more consolidation as the recovery from early August’s dip below $50,000 continues to lose steam.

2024-08-30,"According to CoinDesk: Bitcoin's price dipped below $59,000 on Friday, marking a weekly loss of over 3.5%, as demand for the cryptocurrency wanes and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) see continued net outflows. The decline comes amid signs of reduced institutional interest, with U.S.-listed BTC ETFs recording $71 million in net outflows on Thursday, marking the third consecutive day of withdrawals, according to data from SoSoValue.The largest withdrawals were seen in Fidelity’s FBTC, which lost $31 million, and Grayscale’s GBTC, which saw outflows of $22 million. Notably, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the world’s largest bitcoin fund by assets under management, recorded its second-ever outflow, totaling $13 million. This shift indicates a move away from bitcoin by professional funds.Despite the overall decline, there are signs of increased interest from U.S. retail investors.

Additionally, bitcoin inflows from international exchanges to Coinbase have increased, suggesting higher demand from U.S. investors—a condition historically associated with price gains.

There is a significant variance in the estimated number of these projects, with some suggesting there are only 80 to 85, while others believe the number exceeds 1,000.

2024-08-29,"According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin miners are facing significant economic challenges due to high operational costs and reduced block rewards. Andy Fajar Handika, CEO and co-founder of Loka Mining, has proposed a solution to address these issues by introducing forward hashrate contracts. These contracts allow miners to sell their future hashrate in exchange for fiat-denominated loans, providing immediate financial support for their operations and growth. Handika explained that these tokenized contracts, available in 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year terms, enable miners to purchase more mining equipment and mitigate price volatility risks. The risk associated with Bitcoin's price fluctuations is transferred to investors who buy the mining contracts. Additionally, creditors benefit from this arrangement as the hashrate forward contracts can be used as collateral for other loans, similar to asset restaking. This method offers an alternative to traditional fundraising approaches, such as initial public offerings or issuing corporate debt, which are typically accessible only to large mining companies. Smaller mining operations often rely on selling their Bitcoin holdings or using them as collateral for decentralized finance (DeFi) loans, which carry significant risks due to potential sudden downturns in Bitcoin's price. The Bitcoin mining industry has been under considerable economic strain. A recent report from cloud mining firm BitFuFu highlighted that mining expenses have surged by 168% over the past year. This increase in costs, coupled with decreased block subsidies, has placed substantial pressure on mining companies. Many are now diversifying their operations into artificial intelligence and high-performance computing to offset the decline in profits. A JPMorgan report also noted the ongoing consolidation within the industry, with cash-rich companies like CleanSpark and Riot Platforms acquiring competitors that can no longer sustain their operations. This consolidation reflects the broader challenges faced by the Bitcoin mining sector as it adapts to the new economic realities post-halving.","Bitcoin miners are facing significant economic challenges due to high operational costs and reduced block rewards. Andy Fajar Handika, CEO and co-founder of Loka Mining, has proposed introducing forward hashrate contracts. These contracts allow miners to sell their future hashrate in exchange for fiat-denominated loans to support their operations and growth."

2024-08-29,"According to CoinDesk, Bitcoin has brought significant benefits to El Salvador, including branding, investments, and tourism, as stated by President Nayib Bukele in a TIME Magazine interview. Despite these advantages, Bukele acknowledged that Bitcoin has not yet achieved the widespread adoption he had hoped for in the country. Under Bukele's leadership, El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and began purchasing it as a treasury asset in 2021. Bukele described the initiative as 'net positive,' though he admitted that the adoption rate has fallen short of expectations. He expressed optimism about the potential for improvements, emphasizing that the initiative has not resulted in any negative outcomes. Bukele highlighted that El Salvador has benefited in multiple ways from its Bitcoin-friendly stance, while the risks warned by institutions like the IMF have not materialized. He noted that the country has gained significant branding, attracted investments, and boosted tourism. Bukele believes that the positive outcomes outweigh the negative, and the issues raised are relatively minor. El Salvador became the first nation to purchase Bitcoin as a treasury asset in September 2021 and adopted it as legal tender the same year. The country also announced plans to issue bonds backed by Bitcoin mined locally and introduced a citizenship through investment scheme for foreigners who donate to the government. Bukele emphasized that El Salvador was a 'first mover' in this space, and now Wall Street companies are offering numerous Bitcoin-related investment products. Additionally, Bitcoin is playing a significant role in the U.S. presidential election this year. El Salvador has accumulated a substantial amount of Bitcoin through direct purchases and its citizenship program. Bukele mentioned that the country holds about $400 million in Bitcoin in its public wallet alone. He concluded by stating, 'I'm not going to say it's the currency of the future, but there's a lot of future in that currency.'","El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele believes Bitcoin has brought significant benefits to El Salvador, including branding, investments and tourism.

2024-08-29,"According to Odaily, recent market analysis by Lookonchain highlights five key indicators to assess whether Bitcoin has reached its peak. These indicators provide insights into the current valuation and potential future movements of Bitcoin (BTC). Here are the details of each indicator: The Rainbow Chart is a long-term valuation tool that uses logarithmic growth curves to predict BTC's potential future price trends. The new Bitcoin Rainbow2023 chart indicates that BTC is still relatively inexpensive. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is another crucial indicator. An RSI value of 70 or above suggests that BTC is overbought and may soon decline, while a value of 30 or below indicates that BTC is oversold and may soon rise. Currently, the RSI stands at 61.87, suggesting that BTC has not yet reached its peak compared to previous data. The 200-Week Moving Average Heatmap shows the current price point as blue, indicating that the price peak has not yet been reached. This suggests that it is a good time to hold and buy BTC. The Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD) metric shows that when BTC's price touches the green line, it is undervalued, indicating a good buying opportunity. The current CVDD suggests that BTC's peak has not yet been reached. Lastly, the Yearly Moving Average Multiplier shows BTC's price between the red and green lines. Since it has not yet touched the red line, it indicates that the market has not peaked.

2024-08-28,"According to CoinDesk, Stacks, the Bitcoin layer-2 blockchain, has commenced the Satoshi upgrade, aiming to decouple its block production schedule from Bitcoin's. This upgrade, named after Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, seeks to enhance transaction speeds on the Stacks network. Network operators have a two-week window to implement the Nakamoto upgrade, after which a hard fork will finalize the process. The upgrade introduces a new method for producing Stacks blocks using a proof-of-transfer consensus algorithm. In this system, users burn bitcoin (BTC) to mine Stacks blocks and receive rewards. This process began in April, with block signers coming online to validate tenures of transactions. Tenures are periods during which miners are assigned to produce multiple blocks that are ultimately settled on Bitcoin. Stacks aims to increase utility by introducing smart contracts and other decentralized finance-related functions using Bitcoin as a base layer. As part of this initiative, Stacks is also rolling out sBTC, a bridging asset that allows users to bridge their BTC to the Stacks economy. The token used for the network, STX, has seen a decline of over 8% in the last 24 hours.

2024-08-28,"According to Cointelegraph, in an era where artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, the authenticity of online content is increasingly in question. Jeff Garzik, co-founder and CEO of Bloq, discussed with Cointelegraph how the Bitcoin network might offer a solution for data provenance in the 21st century. Garzik highlighted the current issue of AI-generated content overshadowing trusted sources of information. He emphasized that this problem will likely intensify as AI becomes more prevalent. Data provenance, which involves verifying the origin of data, will become crucial in a future dominated by AI agents. Garzik provided an example of an AI agent autonomously managing and trading crypto assets for a human investor, requiring minimal human input for confirmation. To address this issue, Garzik proposed using the Bitcoin network as a data anchoring layer. This process involves authenticating the origin of data by recording it on the blockchain. He argued that Bitcoin's blockchain is the most secure and likely to persist over the next decade, making it an ideal choice for anchoring data. Garzik noted that other blockchain networks often prune ledger data, making them unsuitable for permanent data provenance. Garzik also mentioned the potential problem of network congestion if data were anchored directly to the Bitcoin base layer. He pointed to the recent surge in Bitcoin Runes and Ordinals mints as an example of how network congestion can drive up transaction fees. To mitigate this, Garzik and his team at Bloq have developed Hemi, a Bitcoin layer-2 network. Hemi handles most of the network traffic while leveraging Bitcoin's base layer for final settlement, thus reducing network bloat and transaction fees. Garzik used the analogy of a champagne waterfall to illustrate the importance of layer-2 solutions, where the top glass represents the Bitcoin base layer, and the overflow is managed by layer-2 solutions. Garzik concluded by stating that the interaction between Bitcoin layer-2 solutions and the base layer would benefit users by lowering transaction fees while maintaining high security. This approach aims to preserve the integrity and reliability of the Bitcoin network as a foundation for data provenance in an AI-driven world.","The authenticity of online content is increasingly in question.

2024-08-28,"According to 10x Research: Bitcoin's market dynamics have recently taken a sharp turn, with traders experiencing significant liquidations as the cryptocurrency struggles to maintain levels above $60,000. This analysis delves into the factors behind the current volatility, offering insights into what might be driving these sudden market shifts.Accurate Predictions but Reversed GainsOn August 22, our forecast accurately predicted Bitcoin's breakout from a symmetrical triangle, leading to a rally toward the $65,000 mark. This surge was fueled by dovish remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which initially supported a +10% gain. However, these gains have since fully reversed, raising concerns about potential risks as we approach September.Massive Bitcoin Withdrawals: A Bullish or Bearish Signal?In the past 24 hours, nearly 50,000 Bitcoins have been withdrawn from exchanges. Typically, such large withdrawals indicate a bullish trend, as investors move their assets into cold storage for long-term holding. This reduces immediate selling pressure, suggesting confidence in Bitcoin's future price appreciation. However, the fact that these withdrawals were concentrated on a single exchange raises questions about the underlying reasons.Declining Open Interest and Market MisinterpretationsOpen interest in Bitcoin futures has sharply declined over the past 24 hours, likely due to traders being stopped out near the close of the U.S. session. This decline in open interest coincides with significant liquidations that began around the $62,000 resistance level— a barrier that had held since early August.Many market participants appear to have misinterpreted Powell's speech, overly focusing on the prospect of imminent monetary easing. However, Powell's remarks highlighted weaknesses in the labour market, signalling that while rate cuts may be on the horizon, they do not equate to immediate economic stimulus.What Lies Ahead: Tactical Opportunities or Increased Risk?As we move into a critical week for risk assets, with key economic data releases on the horizon, the market's response will be crucial. Despite supportive factors like corporate share buybacks, even major stock indices like the Nasdaq have struggled to rally.For traders, today's drop presents an intriguing opportunity for those looking to capitalize on a tactical rally. Entering the market at $59,000 with a tight stop at $58,000 could be a cautious yet strategic move. However, the sudden and concentrated Bitcoin withdrawals suggest that there may be more at play than meets the eye.ConclusionBitcoin's current market volatility reflects a complex mix of factors, from macroeconomic signals to significant movements within crypto exchanges. As traders navigate these uncertain waters, understanding the broader context and potential underlying issues will be key to making informed decisions. With September looming, the next few weeks could be pivotal for Bitcoin's market trajectory.","Bitcoin's market dynamics have taken a sharp turn, with traders experiencing significant liquidations as the cryptocurrency struggles to maintain levels above $60,000.

Source: CoinMarketCap According to an Aug. 27 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha, this is the first time the realized capitalization of long-term holders has exceeded $10 billion. The realized cap reflects the price at which each Bitcoin was last sold and is often used to gauge market sentiment.Long-term holders, defined as those who have held Bitcoin for over 155 days, are less likely to sell during short-term market dips. Since Bitcoin started trading below $69,000 on July 30, the selling pressure from these holders has decreased by 3.7 times, according to another CryptoQuant analyst, Axel Adler.Currently, Bitcoin is trading at around $59,404, down 5.47% in the past 24 hours and 0.11% over the past week. This price is approximately 8% lower than the $64,490 average that long-term holders paid, as reported by ChainExposed.Despite the recent price drop, many traders believe the market could see further declines, potentially forcing long-term holders to continue holding out for better profit opportunities. Some traders view the $50,000 level as critical support; a break below this could introduce further uncertainty in the market.This trend follows a June report by Glassnode, which found that about 75% of all circulating Bitcoin had not been moved in over six months, indicating strong holding behaviour among Bitcoin investors.","Bitcoin's price has dropped below $60,000.

2024-08-28,"According to PANews, Matrixport has released a new report indicating that Bitcoin experienced a sudden significant drop this morning. The decline follows insufficient bullish momentum after Monday's trading. Last week, Bitcoin saw an uptick due to dovish comments from the Federal Reserve, leading to purchases by bullish investors who may now have been liquidated. Today's pullback appears to lack a clear triggering event, suggesting that liquidations in a low liquidity environment might be the primary cause. If Bitcoin falls below the $59,000 mark, it could lead to increased market concerns.","Bitcoin has dropped to $59,000 this morning.

2024-08-28,"According to BlockBeats, on August 28, Bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital sold $300 million in convertible notes to acquire 4,144 Bitcoins, mirroring the strategy employed by MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy's Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has significantly increased his company's Bitcoin holdings through large-scale borrowing, making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders globally. Marathon Digital's move highlights the challenges faced by the mining industry, where mining profits have significantly declined, forcing companies to explore alternative methods to sustain operations. Due to Bitcoin halving and increased mining difficulty, Marathon Digital has adopted a 'fully HODL' strategy, retaining all mined Bitcoins and using debt financing to purchase more. This approach aims to bolster the company's reserves by holding Bitcoin and making opportunistic purchases during market lows, with the expectation that future Bitcoin price increases will yield higher investment returns. Industry experts believe that as Bitcoin mining profitability decreases, the pressure on mining companies intensifies, and debt financing may see a resurgence across the sector. Marathon's strategy is viewed as a pragmatic response to current industry challenges and reflects its confidence in Bitcoin's long-term value.","Marathon Digital sold $300 million in convertible notes to acquire 4,144 Bitcoins on August 28.

""I think it's important to step back from a high level and understand acute trading risks versus cyclical downturn risks,"" Farrell argues. He continues, ""If you step back and listen to [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome] Powell at Jackson Hole and think about the Fed's positioning around markets right now and how they've shifted focus away from inflation towards employment, they've kind of taken away the right tail — or should I say, the worst case scenario for crypto — which would be a stagflationary period in which real growth is slowing and the Fed has to step up and be hawkish regardless of that fact because inflation is soaring."" He notes that such a stagflationary period occurred back in 2022, causing liquidity conditions to tighten amid high inflation. However, it appears as if the Federal Reserve is moving away from that scenario as it gears up for its interest rate easing cycle, which will benefit bitcoin down the line: ""We are certainly going to meet any kind of recession with more easing, more liquidity, in which case, bitcoin will be the fastest horse out of there.""

""If you look at the historical averages, September really is the only month in which bitcoin has an average negative return. But you know, we like to advise our clients and subscribers that you can't just look at seasonality in and of itself.

Instead of focusing on seasonality, he encourages investors to watch the Federal Reserve's next moves as it gears up for an interest rate easing cycle.

Cornell University professor Eswar Prasad speaks on the voter demographic crypto-friendly policies open up for the two candidates, particularly Trump, heading into November. ""Trump does seem to view crypto, the crypto community, as a potential source of support, both financial and in terms of votes because this is largely a young, male-dominated ecosystem,"" the author of The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution is Transforming Currencies and Finance tells the Market Domination team, going on to say: ""What is equally interesting, though, is that the Harris campaign does seem to be somewhat more open to crypto. They haven't laid out a policy position on this yet, but there are indications that there is some outreach from the campaign to the crypto community."" But is the fact key political figures are warming up to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC-USD) and their respective ETFs, legitimizing these decentralized assets, actually hurting the crypto cause? ""The irony here is that the whole point of Bitcoin was to get away from traditional financial institutions, to get away from reliance on any sort of government trust,"" Prasad says. ""So this was supposed to be a trustless technology, but it seems to be being swept into the arms of traditional finance and into the mainstream...

2024-08-12,"Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 35% year to date, the crypto asset currently hovering below $60,000, and with big gains comes big tax responsibilities. Gordon Law Partner Andrew Gordon joins Wealth! to break down the best tax strategies for crypto investors and how the industry might change following the 2024 presidential election. ""Although cryptocurrency can be considered very complex from a tax standpoint, at the most basic level it's taxed much the same as stocks or other securities. And so there are long-term and short-term capital gains, and you're taxed every time there's an exchange, a swap, or a sale. But what makes crypto unique is that you're not just taxed when you cash out to cash, but you're also taxed every time you convert from one crypto to another,"" Gordon explains. As the presidential election is under three months away, Gordon notes that politicians are speaking about crypto more than ever before: ""It seems to mark a shift from regulation by enforcement, which we have seen for several years through agencies such as the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), but perhaps now a shift to politicians supporting and embracing crypto and implementing regulation and legislation to support to allow innovation to occur and to allow individuals to hold crypto and not become criminals."" Crypto executives met with White House officials via video call last week to express their concerns about how the Biden administration and regulators have treated the industry. While the Republican Party has embraced cryptocurrency more than the Democratic Party, Gordon explains the issue is bipartisan. ""What I hope will happen over time is that it becomes an issue that regardless of which side of the political front you're on, that you understand that the crypto tax side of things needs to change. With over 40% of Americans holding cryptocurrency, it's time that the tax gap be reduced by policies that allow individual investors to report crypto simply, easily, and also allow the IRS, the Treasury, to collect on taxes that are rightfully owed,"" he adds.

Wall Street was rocked on Monday as US equities (^GSPC, ^DJI, ^IXIC) were in a free fall, finding some relief and eventually staging a bounce back on Tuesday.

Yahoo Finance Reporter Jared Blikre breaks down the top takeaways for the trading day on Tuesday, August 6. KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst Jackson Ader joins Asking For A Trend to give insight into the tech sector, how its performing, and what investors need to know. In terms of a chief concern this earnings season for Big Tech CapEx spending, Ader relates back to Microsoft (MSFT) and its recent earnings: ""What Microsoft said was, hey, we're actually a little bit more flexible than maybe you realize only half of our CapEx really goes into those fixed long term, 15, 20 year assets. And the other half is kits and GPUs. Maybe they're going to be GPUs, maybe they're going to be CPUs, maybe they're going to be in-house chips, but the focus on flexibility in artificial intelligence, I think is going to be a really good one, and key for the industry..."" The S&P 500 recovered some of its sell-off losses, closing Tuesday's session 1.03% higher. While the widespread selling activity erased a sizable chunk of the Magnificent Seven's market cap, is this pattern of peak-to-trough declines really unprecedented for the index? Julie Hyman breaks down Goldman Sachs charts illustrating the S&P 500's history of sell-offs and ability to bounce back from similar pullbacks. Oil markets (CL=F, BZ=F) are experiencing a rebound along the broader market and as tensions rise in the Middle East. Sankey Research president and lead analyst Paul Sankey explains, ""This latest issue that we're facing between Israel and Iran is not in itself even a new twist to the plot. And in that regard, if you think back to, say, 2019, when Iranian proxies attacked Saudi Arabia and knocked out 7 million barrels a day of capacity, or when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, I'm sad to say that the current environment is not very scary for oil supply interruptions. I will say that the markets are quite scary. So the financial markets are really driving oil right now."" Lastly, a slew of companies released their latest quarterly reports after the market close.

He joins Market Domination to discuss some of the investment opportunities overlooked during the day's market pullback. Newton points to the XLB healthcare sector ETF (XLB) as one opportunity for investors, as it has steadily grown in 2024 and hit record highs despite an ongoing sell-off since mid-July. He also highlights that equal-weighted industrials and financial ETFs from Invesco — (RSPN) and (RSPF) — both hit new all-time highs last week. He notes that these areas of the market are being ""disguised"" and ""camouflaged"" by the ""Big Tech wreck."" ""Investors have been overexposed, have huge concentration in technology. So a big sell-off like that in an area which is a major focus certainly hurts,"" Newton adds. ""But I would say that honestly, for those that diversify, there are plenty of parts of the market that are still working well. And now with a big breakdown on the dollar, that eventually is going to start to aid emerging markets when we can see a little bit of stabilization to this."" Despite bitcoin (BTC-USD) having its worst week since November 2022, Newton argues that the movement is ""really just a drop in the bucket"" : ""I don't see much more deterioration beyond really the mid to high 40s. And I think we will bottom and we can pull out of this. But it is going to be important for the broader risk asset space to stabilize. It's very unusual and unlikely to see bitcoin simply surge back to new highs if the rest of the world is falling apart.

He explains that SEC regulations for approval prohibited ETFs from participating in staking, meaning ""you're not getting the yield you would get if you were a long-term buy and hold Eth[ereum] holder on chain.""
